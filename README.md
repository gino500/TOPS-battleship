# TOPS-battleship

## Description
A simple Battleship Game played against an AI. The goal wasn't to focus on the UI, but more so what is happening behind the scenes. Tried keeping everything clear & concise. Many improvements could be made, for example, refactoring repeating code, fixing all drag & drop bugs, discarding data-attributes in the DOM, and limit the amount of nested arrays.
